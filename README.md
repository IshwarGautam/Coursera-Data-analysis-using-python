# Coursera-Data-analysis-using-python
This is the very well explained course that I found from Coursera. There are total five assignment (from module 1 to module 5) that I have completed by my own. This course is very easy for beginner also. I was not beginner. I was taking this as a recap. So, I didn't feel any difficult and successfully completed this course.
Those who are here to see the assignment, I highly recommend you to try at least by your own first. If they didn't get after several try, then they can take this as reference.
